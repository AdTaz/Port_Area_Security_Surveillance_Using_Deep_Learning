# Port_Area_Security_Surveillance_Using_Deep_Learning

Our goal for this project was to identify the different classes of vehicles in Bangladesh to ensure that we can use them for Port Area Security Surveillance. We successfully used our model to identify and localize the various classes of vehicles using YOLOv4 along with that we were able to show counting of vehicles perfectly for each frame then we stored each vehicle's picture from the frame for further inspection and tracking. We used different evaluation matrix to show our result.
